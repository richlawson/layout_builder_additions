INTRODUCTION
------------

The Layout Builder Additions module provides additions for the core Layout 
Builder module that improves the UI and experience. This module is currently 
available for Drupal 8.7.7+ and 9.x.x.

The primary features include:

* Combine the "Configure block" and "Block description" in the UI for inline
blocks.

  When creating an inline block, the "Configure block" heading and the "Block
  description" take up quite a bit of space. It would be better for the block
  description to be combined so that it reads "Configure block: ." For a block
  type called Accordion, for example, the heading would read "Configure block:
  Accordion."

  This module will work with both the core Layout Builder interface, as well as
  with the recommended Layout Builder Modal module (see below).

* Adds a "Layout" entity operation.

  Adds a "Layout" entity operation for content types that allow overridable
  layouts. This is useful on the content admin screen to save extra steps/clicks
  for editing layouts.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

This module requires the Layout Builder module in Drupal core.
